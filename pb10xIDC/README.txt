pb10xIDC: 4763 P. berghei cells that passed QC from the IDC, same run as allpb10x, just with gametocytes removed. 

important pheno columns:

absclust: cell cluster assignment based on CCA, shown in figure 3B

PC1 and PC2: PCA coordinates that were used in scmap for cell assignment based on pc coordinate space and for calculating clock_pseudotime

bulk: hoo bulk pearson prediction

clock_pseudotime: pseudotime assignment based on clock method
